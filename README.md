An auditory visualization of "speaking" in penny-arcade's clock talk language


http://www.wavtones.com/functiongenerator.php

Dots represent 75Hz Burst 0.2sec on/off is base - 100 - 3200Hz are the dots.

so 75Hz is the "I'm speaking" tone. vowels are fractions on 1 second.
0.2 = A
0.4 = E
0.5 = I
0.75 = O
1.00 = U

C = 3200,1600,(800-400),75
L = (3200-1600),75
O = 0.75s@75
C = 3200,1600,(800-400),75
K = 100,200,400,(800-3200)
- = 0Hz 0.2s
T = 100,200,(400-1600),3200

Join lines are "Sweep1" - sweeping from the lower to the higher
